​​# Swarm Extension Privacy Policy

The Swarm Extension is owned by the Swarm Foundation ("We"). We do not track or collect any of your Personal Data, nor do we sell it to anyone else or use it for advertising.

By installing Swarm Extension, you accept this privacy policy.

## What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy explains that we don’t gather, track, nor permanently store any of your Personal Data. It also covers Additional Privacy Protocols related to the way the Swarm Extension allows people to add and retrieve data to and from the Swarm Network (which is a peer-to-peer network). This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to projects run by other organizations outside Swarm Foundation, even if we promote the use of those projects or happen to contribute to them.

## What Information Is Collected?

We do not collect any data about you, including personal data.

## Explicitly Shared Data Will Be Publicly Available Over The Swarm Network

We do not collect, rent, store or sell your Personal Data to anyone. However because Swarm Extension is a web extension that provides access to the real-time, peer-to-peer Swarm Network (which is a public platform for which anyone may join and participate) the data that you import to the Swarm Network using Swarm Extension is then publicly available and accessible to everyone participating in Swarm Network.

## Additional Privacy Protocols

If you add files to the Swarm Network using the Swarm Extension, they will be split into pieces and stored across nodes on the network. Those files are also then cached by anyone who retrieves those files from the Swarm network and co-hosted on that user’s local Swarm Network node. Generally, cached files will eventually expire, but it’s possible for a user with whom you have shared access to such files (by sharing the relevant Content Identifier) to pin that data, which means the cached files then will not expire and will remain stored on such user’s local Swarm Network node.

All content shared with the Swarm Network is public by default. This means your files and data that you’ve added will be accessible to everyone who knows the Content Identifier or queries the data on the Swarm Network. If you want to share certain materials or data privately, you must encrypt such data before adding it to the Swarm Network.

Websites will be able to detect you are running Swarm Extension. To disable this behavior use incognito mode or turn off the extension.

## Will The Privacy Policy Be Changed?

We’re constantly trying to improve Swarm Extension, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy sometimes. When we do, we will update it on our [Github page](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-extension/commits/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.md) where you will be able to track changes.
We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed, which is ultimately your responsibility. If you use Swarm Extension after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of those changes.

## Where Can I Raise My Questions?
