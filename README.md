# Swarm Extension

**Warning: This project has Proof of Concept state now. There will be breaking changes continuously in the future. Also, no guarantees can be made about its stability, efficiency, and security at this stage. It only provides a platform currently to show workarounds and examples for the current problems in dApp environments top on Swarm**

This extension is a Chromium based extension since this platform seems the be the bottleneck for creating custom behaviours.
The whole project is a hack. It only points out the current problems within dApp ecosystem in regular Web2 browsers,
but on the other hand its goal to show alternatives how to build a real Web3 environment for dApps in structural sense.
